This is a project which Edward Pearce worked on as part of his internship last year (2019). It uses statistical tests to analyze the quality of Simulara I and II against real tumour data.

It is all run from analysis.ipynb which is a jupyter notebook. Sadly, you won't be able to run it as is because it relies on you having a CAS access account. However, you can read about his methods, and maybe try applying them to any dummy dataset you can find.
